- The code work with the platform of **Python 3.7** and necessary libraries, including **sklearn (verision 0.22)**, **numpy**, **matplotlib** and **graphviz**.

- Three machine learning algorithms are adopted, including *decision tree, k-nearest neigbhour and support vector machine*.

-The SVM owns best accuracy while its efficiency is not good. For more details, please read the report.
